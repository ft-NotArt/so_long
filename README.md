# ⭐ **SO_LONG** ⭐

### **Here's my so_long, a very cool project in which we have to code a labyrinth video game using a given graphic library**

## 👀 Inspiration

I got inspired the theme of my so_long when I came across this art from **kidd** ([@WeSatInTheCar](https://x.com/WeSatInTheCar)) on Twitter :

## 🕹️ Gameplay

In order to progress through **stages**, you'll have to defeat the **enemies** present in the area\
But those are not **defenseless** ! They will try to **attack** you if you come too close !\
You'll start with only a simple **attack**, but with the power to absorb those of your enemies, thus becoming **stronger** as you go through more foes...
### 🔥 Hard Mode
When compiling using the Makefile, you can use the `make hard` rule to launch the game as **yoshi** instead of **kirby** !\
Doing so, you'll give up your *ability to absorb enemies powers* !

## 🧭 Levels

I made 4 maps to play the game as pleasantly as possible, I hope you'll like them ✨\
Those were made to be played in this order :
* whispy_woods
* fountains_of_dream
* factory
* boss_room

Launch the game using `./so_long maps/whispy_woods.ber maps/fountains_of_dream.ber maps/factory.ber maps/boss_room.ber`

## 🎮 Commands

You can use :
- **[ WASD ]** or **[ ↑←↓→ ]** to move
- **[ 123 ]** to use powers (num pads / above letters)
- **ESC** to leave the game

And that's all ! (I think ?)
